    "# Preparation: Data Collection Using Web Scraping\n",
    "\n",
    "Web scraping is the automated process of extracting data from websites. It involves writing code to access web pages, retrieve the HTML content, and extract specific information from the page, such as text, images, links, or structured data.\n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of web scraping in data mining is to gather data from various websites in a structured and systematic manner. It allows organizations and individuals to collect large amounts of data from the web for analysis, research, or other purposes. Here are some key purposes of web scraping in data mining:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Data Collection:** Web scraping enables the extraction of data from multiple sources on the internet, including websites, online directories, social media platforms, e-commerce sites, and more. It automates the data collection process, saving time and effort compared to manual data entry.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Market Research:** Web scraping can be used to gather market data, such as product prices, customer reviews, competitor information, and trends. This information helps businesses analyze the market landscape, identify pricing strategies, monitor competitors, and make informed decisions.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Sentiment Analysis:** By scraping data from social media platforms, forums, or review sites, web scraping can be used to gather user-generated content and perform sentiment analysis. This analysis helps in understanding public opinion, identifying customer preferences, and monitoring brand reputation.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Lead Generation:** Web scraping can be employed to extract contact information, such as email addresses or phone numbers, from websites. This data can be used for lead generation purposes, customer acquisition, or marketing campaigns.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Data Integration:** Web scraping allows the aggregation of data from different websites into a single database or system. This integration enables the combination of disparate data sources and enhances data analysis and reporting capabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Price Comparison and Monitoring:** E-commerce websites often change their prices dynamically. Web scraping can be utilized to gather product information and prices from multiple online stores, enabling price comparison and monitoring. This information helps consumers find the best deals and assists businesses in adjusting their pricing strategies.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is important to note that while web scraping offers valuable opportunities for data mining, it is crucial to respect website terms of service and legal requirements. Always ensure you comply with applicable laws and respect the website's policies when scraping data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Web Scraping typically involves two main steps: (a) fetching/downloading the web page and (b) extracting the relevant information. A web page is commonly a HTML document containing paragraphs, images, tables, and all kinds of content, and the relevant content can be found somewhere in this structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "To extract the right content from a web page using Python, [`BeautifulSoup`](https://pypi.org/project/beautifulsoup4/) is an excellent package; downloading the web pages in the first place is even easier with Python. In this notebook, we go through a very basic example. As use case we scrape the names of all the shopping malls in Singapore from Wikipedia."

    "## Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "Web Scraping, particular when using the right tools or packages, is a reasonably straightforward task. However, there are a number of challenges or even obstacles in the way:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Manual effort:** As we have seen above, extracting the relevant information requires inspecting the HTML source code to find the right elements needed. In our example, this was pretty easy, but can get very tricky in practice and might require a lot of additional filtering or rules/heuristics to get rid of irrelevant bits in the HTML content.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Maintenance:** Sometimes it is necessary to scrape the same web page periodically (e.g., to fetch the latest updates). Any change of the layout and the HTML structure might break the scraper. For example, let's say the shopping malls on the Wikipedia page will no longer be listed using `<li>` tags but in one or more tables. In this case, the code above will no longer work.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Dynamic pages:** Most modern websites load the content dynamically, e.g., via Javascript/Ajax request -- that is, the initial request fetches Javascript code that gets executed by the browser to fetch more content. Packages such as `requests` cannot execute Javascript. As such, the received HTML content will only contain the information about Javascript code (potentially just the URL of a Javascript file to be loaded). While there are solutions involving Javascript engines to scrape such dynamic websites, the required efforts quickly explode.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Legal issues:** There's a long-standing debate if it is legal to collect the content from websites. I'm not a lawyer but I hope that Wikipedia does not cause any problems. We also do not use the data for commercial purposes. For further information, I recommend the following [article](https://singaporelegaladvice.com/law-articles/legal-scrape-crawl-websites-data-singapore/).\n",
    "\n",
    "In short, using an API is always the preferred method to collect data. Of course, this assumes that a platform provides such an API."
