    "# Tokenization\n",
    "\n",
    "Tokenization is a fundamental process in Natural Language Processing (NLP) that involves breaking down a text or sentence into smaller units called tokens. A token is typically a word, but it can also be a character, subword, or any other meaningful unit of text. Tokenization plays a crucial role in NLP tasks because many algorithms and models operate at the token level, treating each token as a discrete unit for further analysis or processing. By splitting text into tokens, we gain a structured representation that can be leveraged for various NLP tasks, such as text classification, named entity recognition, machine translation, sentiment analysis, and more.\n",
    "\n",
    "The tokenization process can vary depending on the specific requirements of the task or the language being processed. Here are some common approaches to tokenization:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Character Tokenization:** In character tokenization, each character becomes a separate token. For example, the word \"tokenization\" would be tokenized into [\"t\", \"o\", \"k\", \"e\", \"n\", \"i\", \"z\", \"a\", \"t\", \"i\", \"o\", \"n\"].\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Word Tokenization:** This method splits text into individual words. For example, the sentence \"Tokenization is important for NLP tasks\" would be tokenized into the tokens [\"Tokenization\", \"is\", \"important\", \"for\", \"NLP\", \"tasks\"].\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Subword Tokenization**: Subword tokenization splits text into smaller units, such as subword pieces or morphemes. This approach is useful for languages with complex morphology or when dealing with out-of-vocabulary (OOV) words. Examples of subword tokenization algorithms include Byte-Pair Encoding (BPE) and WordPiece.\n",
    "\n",
    "Tokenization is not always a straightforward process, as certain challenges can arise. For instance, handling contractions (\"can't\" split into \"can\" and \"'t\") or punctuation (\"Mr. Smith\" treated as [\"Mr\", \".\", \"Smith\"]) require careful consideration in the tokenization process. Tokenization is typically one of the initial steps in NLP pipelines, serving as a foundation for subsequent tasks such as text preprocessing, feature extraction, and model training. The resulting tokens can be further processed, encoded, or represented in numerical form for computational analysis. Various NLP libraries and frameworks provide built-in tokenization functionalities, making it easier to tokenize text in different languages and handle various tokenization requirements.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we focus on **word tokenization** as it is the most fundemantal approach for many to most NLP tasks. "

    "\n",
    "spaCy's tokenizer is responsible for breaking down text into individual linguistic units, such as words or punctuation marks. It follows a set of rules and heuristics to determine where to split the text. Here's a general overview of how the tokenizer in spaCy works:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Whitespace Splitting:** The tokenizer initially splits the text on whitespace characters (e.g., spaces, tabs, newlines) to create token candidates.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Prefix Rules:** The tokenizer applies a set of prefix rules to identify and split off leading punctuation marks, such as opening quotation marks or brackets. For example, the tokenizer would split \"Hello!\" into two tokens, \"Hello\" and \"!\".\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Suffix Rules:** Similarly, the tokenizer applies suffix rules to identify and split off trailing punctuation marks, such as periods or closing quotation marks. For example, it would split \"example.\" into two tokens, \"example\" and \".\".\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Infixes:** The tokenizer then looks for infixes, which are sequences of characters that appear within a word. It uses rules to determine where to split these infixes, typically when they indicate word boundaries. For instance, the tokenizer would split \"can't\" into \"ca\" and \"n't\".\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Special Cases:** spaCy's tokenizer handles special cases, such as contractions, abbreviations, emoticons, or currency symbols, where the standard rules might not apply. It uses language-specific knowledge and a customizable list of special case rules to tokenize these instances correctly.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Tokenization Exceptions:** spaCy provides a mechanism to define exceptions to the tokenization rules using custom tokenization patterns. This allows users to override the default behavior and handle specific cases according to their needs.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Post-processing:** After applying the tokenization rules, the tokenizer performs additional post-processing steps. This may involve removing leading or trailing white spaces, normalizing Unicode characters, or applying language-specific transformations.\n",

    "## Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "Tokenization is a fundamental step in Natural Language Processing (NLP) that involves breaking down text into smaller units called tokens. These tokens can be individual words, subwords, characters, or even linguistic units like sentences or paragraphs. Tokenization serves as the first step in processing raw text data to enable further analysis and modeling. The primary goal of tokenization is to establish a standardized representation of textual data that can be easily understood and processed by NLP algorithms. By breaking down text into tokens, NLP models can effectively capture the structure, semantics, and statistical properties of language.\n",
    "\n",
    "Tokenization techniques vary depending on the specific requirements and characteristics of the task at hand. The most common form of tokenization is word tokenization, where text is segmented into individual words. This approach assumes that words are the basic building blocks of meaning in language. However, in certain cases, subword tokenization can be used to handle out-of-vocabulary words, rare or misspelled words, or languages with complex morphology.\n",
    "\n",
    "Tokenization is not limited to word boundaries; it can also involve the identification of sentence boundaries, paragraphs, or even smaller linguistic units like named entities or syntactic constituents. Each token retains important linguistic information, such as part-of-speech, lemma, or position, which can be used for subsequent analysis. In addition to the basic segmentation of text, tokenization often involves other tasks, such as normalizing text by removing punctuation, converting text to lowercase, or handling special cases like contractions or abbreviations. These additional steps help to improve the quality and consistency of the tokenized output.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, tokenization plays a crucial role in NLP by transforming raw text into structured data that can be readily processed, analyzed, and modeled by various NLP algorithms and techniques. It serves as a foundation for a wide range of NLP tasks, including sentiment analysis, machine translation, named entity recognition, text classification, and more.\n"
