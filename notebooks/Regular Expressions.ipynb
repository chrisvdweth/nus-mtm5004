    "# Regular Expressions\n",
    "\n",
    "Regular expressions, often abbreviated as RegEx or RegExp, are powerful tools used for pattern matching and text manipulation. They are a sequence of characters that form a search pattern, which is used to match and locate specific patterns within a larger body of text. Regular expressions are widely used in various programming languages, text editors, and command-line tools. They provide a concise and flexible way to search, extract, and manipulate text based on specific criteria. Here are some common use cases for regular expressions:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Text search and matching:** Regular expressions can be used to search for specific patterns or sequences of characters within a text document or string. For example, you can search for all occurrences of email addresses, URLs, or phone numbers in a given text.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Text validation and data extraction:** Regular expressions are useful for validating input or extracting specific data from a larger text. You can use them to validate if an input matches a specific pattern, such as a valid email address or a date format. They can also be employed to extract parts of a string that match a particular pattern, such as extracting all the hashtags from a social media post.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Text substitution and manipulation:** Regular expressions allow you to perform advanced text substitution and manipulation. For instance, you can replace all occurrences of a word or phrase with another word, remove unnecessary whitespace or formatting, or reorder elements in a specific way.\n",
    "\n",
    "A regular expression is a pattern that the regular expression engine attempts to match in input text. Each pattern is a combination of literal characters and metacharacters. Literal characters represent themselves and match the exact characters in the text. Metacharacters, on the other hand, have special meanings and provide additional functionality. Regular expressions can become quite complex, allowing for alternation, grouping, quantifiers, character classes, and more. In this notebook we will cover the most important concepts of Regular Expressions in more detail."

    "## Groups\n",
    "\n",
    "In regular expressions, groups are used to define subpatterns within a larger pattern. They allow you to group multiple characters or subexpressions together and apply modifiers or operations to them as a single unit. Groups are denoted by parentheses `(` and `)`. Groups serve several purposes in regular expressions:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Capturing groups:** One common use of groups is to capture and extract specific parts of a matched pattern. When a group is defined within parentheses, the text that matches the group will be captured and made available for further processing. Each capturing group is assigned a number, starting from 1 and incrementing for each subsequent group. For example, the regular expression pattern (\\d{2})-(\\d{2})-(\\d{4}) can be used to match a date in the format \"dd-mm-yyyy\". By using capturing groups, you can extract the day, month, and year separately.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Non-capturing groups:** In some cases, you may want to use parentheses for grouping purposes, but you don't need to capture the matched text as a separate group. Non-capturing groups are denoted by (?:...). They function similarly to capturing groups but don't create numbered references for the matched text. For example, the pattern I(?:l|1)o matches either \"Il\" or \"Io\" but does not capture the specific matched letter.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Grouping for modifiers or quantifiers:** Groups can be used to apply modifiers or quantifiers to a specific sequence of characters. By grouping characters together, you can specify how many times the entire group should be repeated. For example, the pattern (ab)+ matches one or more occurrences of the sequence \"ab\". Without the parentheses, the pattern ab+ would match a single \"a\" followed by one or more \"b\" characters.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Alternation:** Groups allow you to specify alternatives using the | (pipe) character, which acts as an OR operator. It allows you to match one of several alternatives. For example, the pattern (apple|banana|orange) matches either \"apple\", \"banana\", or \"orange\".\n",

They are considered zero-width assertions because they only assert whether a particular position is preceded or followed by a specific pattern, without including the pattern itself in the matched text.\n",
