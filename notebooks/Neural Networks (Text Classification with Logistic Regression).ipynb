    "# Logistic Regression\n",
    "\n",
    "Logistic Regression is a statistical method used for binary classification tasks, predicting the probability of a binary outcome based on input features. Despite its name, it's used for classification, not regression. Here's how Logistic Regression works and its application in text document classification:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Algorithm Overview:** Logistic Regression models the relationship between a set of independent variables (features) and a binary dependent variable (the target class). It uses the logistic function (also called the sigmoid function) to map input features to a probability score between 0 and 1, representing the likelihood of belonging to a particular class.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Text Document Classification:** In the context of text classification, each document is represented as a numerical feature vector. This vector can be constructed using various methods, such as:\n",
    "    * *Bag-of-Words (BoW):* Counts the frequency of words in each document, creating a numerical representation.\n",
    "    * *TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency):* Weights words based on their frequency in a document relative to their frequency across all documents, capturing word importance.\n",
    "    * *Word Embeddings:* Dense, lower-dimensional representations of words that capture semantic relationships and context.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Model Training:** Once text documents are transformed into feature vectors, Logistic Regression fits a linear decision boundary to distinguish between classes based on these features. It learns the weights (coefficients) for each feature and the bias term to make predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Prediction:** During prediction, Logistic Regression uses these learned weights and the logistic (sigmoid) function to calculate the probability of a document belonging to a particular class. A threshold (usually 0.5) is applied to these probabilities to classify documents into the respective classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Regularization:** Logistic Regression models can be regularized to prevent overfitting by adding penalty terms to the objective function. Regularization techniques like L1 or L2 regularization help control model complexity and improve generalization to new data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Logistic Regression is often considered a baseline model for text classification tasks due to its simplicity, interpretability, and efficiency. It's particularly useful when the relationship between features and classes is relatively linear or when there's a need for a straightforward probabilistic interpretation of the results.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, Logistic Regression is a versatile and widely used method in text document classification, providing a probabilistic framework to predict class probabilities based on textual features, aiding in tasks like sentiment analysis, document categorization, or spam detection."

If you check the documentation of [`LogisticRegression`](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.linear_model.LogisticRegression.html), already performs L2 regularization by default. An important parameter is the `solver`. Note that the class constructor does not provide any parameter for a learning rate. This is because Logistic Regression can be solved much faster than using basic Gradient Descent. This is mainly due to loss function being convex, so more optimized techniques can be applied. The reason we cover Logistic Regression with Gradient Descent in the lecture is because it is a more general approach that is directly applicable to neural networks.\n"

In practice, the training is basically always done using batches, i.e., much smaller subset of the data.

The main parameters of this class are the input size (i.e., the number of features / vocabulary size) and the output size which is just 1 for Logistic Regression. The internal parameters of `nn.Linear` are our weights $\\theta$ which also includes the bias $\\theta_0$.

PyTorch offers the `nn.Sigmoid` layer for this (PyTorch calls activations functions also layers).\n",

    "* The loss goes down! This essentially means that our model is learning. This can be very useful as an incorrectly implemented model may not throw an error but not train properly (i.e., the loss not going down). So it's a good sanity check when implementing and using a new model.\n",
    "\n",
    "* The f1 score over the training data is getting close to 1.0 (at least after more epochs). This means that the model learns to correctly predict the label for all training samples. Of course, this is not what we are interested in but (a) again tells us that the model is generally learning, and (b) this might give us insights if our model is overfitting.\n",

    "* The f1 score over the test data quickly plateaus after very few epochs.\n",

    "**Important:** This plot showing the trends for the loss and f1 scores (or other metrics) can look very different depending on the dataset, the network architecture, and the hyperparameters. While in this simple example all trends seem to smoothly converge, this is not the case in general. For example, the f1 score for the test data might see a much steeper drop after peaking, which would even more clearly indicate the model is starting to overfit.\n"

    "### Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "Logistic Regression is a foundational algorithm in machine learning, primarily used for binary classification tasks, including text document classification. In the context of text analysis, Logistic Regression operates by mapping text features—such as word frequencies, TF-IDF values, or word embeddings—into a probability score representing the likelihood of a document belonging to a specific class.\n",
    "\n",
    "For text document classification, each document undergoes a transformation into a numerical feature representation. This transformation captures the essence of the text, enabling Logistic Regression to learn a linear decision boundary that separates different classes based on these features. During training, Logistic Regression learns the weights (coefficients) for each feature and a bias term. It fits a linear model to distinguish between classes, utilizing the sigmoid function to produce probability scores. These probabilities are then thresholded to assign documents to their respective classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Logistic Regression's strengths lie in its simplicity, interpretability, and computational efficiency. It serves as a baseline model for text classification tasks, especially when the relationships between features and classes are relatively linear or when there's a need for probabilistic interpretations of classification results. Overall, Logistic Regression provides a straightforward and effective means of predicting class probabilities for text documents based on their textual features, making it a valuable tool in tasks such as sentiment analysis, document categorization, and spam filtering in natural language processing applications.\n"
